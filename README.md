# serverClientTask
 Create three programs, two of which are clients to a single server. 
 Client1 will send a character to the server process.
 The server will decrement the letter to the next letter in the alphabet and send the result to client2.
 Client2 prints the letter it receives and then all the processes terminate.
 To execute the app make sure to run server first, then client1 and lastly client2. All at the same time.
